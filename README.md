# Weather Analysis with SQLAlchemy and SQLite

Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval using SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database. Then, use statistics like minimum, maximum, and average to analyze data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get your SQLite database up and running on your local machine.


### Prerequisites

Before the installations there are some important concepts you need to know:  

**SQLite**, a version of SQL that lives in the computer or phone and provides a quick way to setup a database engine without requiring a server. SQLite's main purpose is to supporting quick testing and easy prototyping. When prototyping, it is not ideal to set up a SQL database server just to test something out. You can compare SQLite databases to a CSV or Excel file: each SQLite database can have one or more tables with columns and rows, and it is stored as a file on your computer. The key difference between SQLite databases and a CSV or Excel file is that you can write queries for it.

**When to use SQLite and PostgreSQL?**

**SQLite** is highly useful for: Standalone apps, small apps that donâ€™t require expansion, apps need to read or write files to disk directly, the internet of things devices, developing and even testing.

**PostgreSQL** is recommended when: Data integrity and reliability is highly concerned, custom Procedures which is extensible to run the complex task, complexity with ease. PostgreSQL gives you the functionality to maintain such a complex database smoothly without limitations.

**SQLAlchemy** is a library that facilitates the communication between Python programs and databases. Most of the times, this library is used as an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) tool that translates Python classes to tables on relational databases and automatically converts function calls to SQL statements.


### Installing

**First**, visit the [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) site and download the last released version for your operating system.  **DB Browser for SQLite**, is a high quality, visual, open source tool to create, design, and edit database files compatible with SQLite.  It is for users and developers who want to create, search, and edit databases. DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, and complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.

**Second**, download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for your operating system.  From your Anaconda Navigator you can launch Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebook.
